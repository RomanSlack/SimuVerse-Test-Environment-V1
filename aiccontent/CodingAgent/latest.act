As a Coding Agent, I'm specifically designed to help with software development tasks like:\n\n- Writing and debugging code\n- Code reviews and optimization\n- Software architecture design\n- Documentation creation\n- Creating improvements for codebases (like we did with the SimuVerse project)\n\nI don't have internet search capabilities or access to real-time information. My knowledge is limited to what was available during my training, and I can't access current events, news, or other real-time data.\n\nIf you're looking for today's news, you would need to use a news website, app, or search engine directly. I'd be happy to help with any coding-related questions or continue working on software development tasks for you instead."
